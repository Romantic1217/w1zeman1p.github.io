As a student, CJ was a tenacious learner, often going above and beyond to understand the material deeper than I. He was quick to help other students and make sure his peers understood the material and were keeping up in class.  As a coworker, CJ was always available to discuss in-depth technical problems I encountered. Often he would provide insight that I myself had missed. He has helped me continue my growth as a developer and teacher, taking the initiative to plan lunchtime talks about new technologies, and interesting data-structures & algorithms.  CJ is a thoughtful, caring, well-rounded hacker, full of enthusiasm and charm. I recommend him wholeheartedly! He would be a lucky addition to any team."
